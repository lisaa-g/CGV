<h2>Lab 5: Shaders and Lighting</h2>

<div class="intro">


<p>Creating a complete WebGL shader lab from scratch is a complex task, 
but I can provide you with a basic example to get you started. 
This example demonstrates the use of vertex and fragment shaders in WebGL.
To create a complete lab, you'd need to set up an HTML page and shaders.</p>


<p>I have provided you with "Lab5.1.html". This example is currently missing a lot
of things. For this first part of the lab I want you to set up a shader program
which can render the cube defined using an IFS. This cube should be render as a
solid color and should look like the image below.</p>

<p class="np"><img src="cube.png" style="border:none"  height="500" width="500"></p>

<p>The first step will be inspect the code provided to see what is missing. As you
will observe we need implement both the vertex shader as well as the fragment shader.
Have a think of what variables will be required and what needs to be done to pass
that information to your shader. Below is the raw vertex information that should be 
used to draw the cube.
</p>

<pre class="code">// Define the vertices for a cube
   const vertices = new Float32Array([
       -1, -1, -1,
        1, -1, -1,
       -1,  1, -1,
        1,  1, -1,
       -1, -1,  1,
        1, -1,  1,
       -1,  1,  1,
        1,  1,  1,
   ]);

   // Define indices to form triangles
   const indices = new Uint16Array([
       0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, // Front face
       4, 5, 6, 5, 6, 7, // Back face
       0, 1, 4, 1, 4, 5, // Bottom face
       2, 3, 6, 3, 6, 7, // Top face
       0, 2, 4, 2, 4, 6, // Left face
       1, 3, 5, 3, 5, 7  // Right face
   ]);

   const colors = new Float32Array([
   // RGB color values for each vertex
       1, 0, 0, // Red
       0, 1, 0, // Green
       0, 0, 1, // Blue
       1, 1, 0, // Yellow
       0, 1, 1, // Cyan
       1, 0, 1, // Magenta
       0.5, 0.5, 0.5, // Gray
       1, 0.5, 0.5, // Light Red
   ]);</pre>

  <ol>
   <li>
       <h2>Step 1: Create a Buffer for Vertices and Indices</h2>
       <p>In WebGL, you need to create a buffer to store the vertices and indices of your cube. Vertices represent the points that make up the cube's geometry, and indices define how these vertices connect to form triangles or other shapes.
      </p>
       <pre>
           <code>
            createBuffer() - Create a buffer
            bindBuffer(target, buffer) - Bind the buffer
            bufferData(target, data, usage) - Fill the buffer with data</code>
       </pre>
   </li>

   <li>
       <h2>Step 2: Define Transformation Matrices for Modelview and Perspective Transformations</h2>
       <p>Transformation matrices are used to position and orient the cube within the 3D world. The modelview matrix defines the position and orientation of the cube in world space, while the perspective matrix sets up the camera's view and projection properties.
      </p>
       <pre>
           <code>
            Matrix Libraries - Use a library like gl-matrix
            mat4.create() - Create a matrix
            mat4.identity() - Initialize the modelview matrix
</code>
       </pre>
   </li>

   <li>
       <h2>Step 3: Get Attribute and Uniform Variable Locations Matching the Shader</h2>
       <p>In your WebGL program, you'll have a vertex shader and a fragment shader. You need to obtain the locations of attributes (such as vertex positions) and uniforms (like transformation matrices) in your shaders. This allows you to send data from JavaScript to the shaders.
      </p>
       <pre>
           <code>
            getAttribLocation(program, name) - Get attribute location
            getUniformLocation(program, name) - Get uniform location</code>
       </pre>
   </li>

   <li>
       <h2>Step 4: Bind the Position Buffer</h2>
       <p>After creating the vertex buffer, you need to bind it to a WebGL context so that it can be used for rendering. This step ensures that the buffer containing the cube's vertices is available for rendering.
      </p>
       <pre>
           <code>
            bindBuffer(target, buffer) - Bind the buffer
            vertexAttribPointer() - Specify the attribute layout
            enableVertexAttribArray() - Enable the attribute</code>
       </pre>
   </li>

   <li>
       <h2>Step 5: Set Up the Perspective Projection Matrix</h2>
       <p>To create a realistic 3D view, you'll set up a perspective projection matrix. This matrix defines how objects are projected onto the 2D screen, creating a sense of depth and perspective.
      </p>
       <pre>
           <code>
            mat4.perspective() - Set up perspective matrix
            //I am happy if you use the following paramters
            const fov = Math.PI / 4;  // 45 degrees
            const aspect = canvas.width / canvas.height;
            const near = 0.1;
            const far = 100.0;
            mat4.perspective(projectionMatrix, fov, aspect, near, far);

            uniformMatrix4fv(location, transpose, data) - Set the perspective matrix as a uniform</code>
       </pre>
   </li>

   <li>
       <h2>Step 6: Set Up the Modelview Matrix</h2>
       <p>The modelview matrix defines the position, rotation, and scale of the cube. By applying transformations to this matrix, you can position and orient the cube in the 3D world.
      </p>
       <pre>
           <code>
            mat4.translate() - Translate the modelview matrix
            mat4.rotate() - Rotate the modelview matrix
            uniformMatrix4fv(location, transpose, data) - Set the modelview matrix as a uniform</code>
       </pre>
   </li>

   <li>
       <h2>Step 7: Draw the Cube</h2>
       <p>Finally, you'll use WebGL's rendering functions to draw the cube. This involves configuring your shaders and attributes, setting the uniform values (including the transformation matrices), and invoking WebGL's drawing functions to render the cube.
      </p>
       <pre>
           <code>
            bindBuffer(target, buffer) - Bind the index buffer
            drawElements(mode, count, type, offset) - Draw the cube using indices</code>
       </pre>
   </li>
</ol>

<h3>Adding Colour and Motion</h3>

<p>Modify the given template such that we colour each of the given vertices
   a different colour as seen below. Additionally apply a rotation such that 
   you minic the behaviour of the cube in the following gif.
</p>

<img src="coloured_cube.gif" style="text-align:center" width="500" height="500">

<p class="np">In order to do this, you should incorporate the following functions,
   createBuffer, bindBuffer, bufferData, enableVertexAttribArray and 
   vertexAttribPointer. Additionally you will have to modify the given vertex shader
   to take in another attribute variable representing the colour. Do not forget That
   this process requires linking the variable to the shader using getAttribLocation.
   
</p>

For submission Lab 5.1 you are required to submit the Lab5.1.html file to moodle.

<h3>More Advanced Shaders </h3>

<p>In our previous classes, we delved into the concepts of Lambert and Phong 
   shading techniques, exploring the nuances of light interaction and material
   properties in 3D rendering. However, in this section of the lab, we are 
   embarking on a new journey into the world of cell shading. While Lambert and 
   Phong shading are foundational techniques in computer graphics, cell shading 
   offers a unique and distinctive aesthetic, often seen in various art styles 
   and video games. Cell shading, also known as toon shading, allows us to create 
   a visually striking, almost comic book-like appearance in our 3D models</p>

<p>Cell shading, also known as toon shading or comic book shading, is a non-photorealistic 
   rendering (NPR) technique used in computer graphics to create a unique and 
   stylized visual effect that resembles traditional 2D hand-drawn or painted 
   artwork, such as cartoons or comics. Cell shading achieves this effect by 
   simplifying the rendering process and using a limited number of discrete 
   shades or tones to represent different areas of an object's surface.</p>

   <p class="np" style="text-align:center"><img src="cell.jpg"  width="600"></p>

<p>In order to achieve this effect your code should quantize the incoming color's 
   intensity based on a specified cell size and setting the pixel's color to a 
   specific tone. This process is integral to achieving the characteristic 
   appearance of cell shading, which simplifies shading by using a limited set of 
   shading levels to create a stylized, cartoonish, or toon-like effect in
   computer graphics.</p>

<p>You should use ``Lab5.2.html" as the base for this problem and are only required to 
   modify the vertex and fragment shader. To start you should implement
   Lambert shading using the lighting equation presented in class. Then modify the 
   fragment shader as described in the descritpion above in order to achieve the
   effect seen below. For submission Lab 5.2 you are required to submit the Lab5.2.html file to moodle.
